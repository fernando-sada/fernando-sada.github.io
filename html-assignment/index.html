               <p>Hello, my name is Fernando Ruben Sada. I'm 33 years old and I'm originally from the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently, I find myself on a journey as an international student at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada &#127809;. My life in Canada is shared with my wife &#x1F495; and my orange cat &#128008;.</p>
               <p>I aspire to become a better web developer and graphic designer, and I am determined to evolve into a proficient professional in these fields. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have plans to extend my stay in Canada, either by securing a job or as an entrepreneur. I love coffee &#9749; and video games &#x1F3AE; whenever I can spare a moment.</p>
